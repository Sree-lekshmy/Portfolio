            <p>
                I am a passionate professional with diverse experience in software development, web development, and finance. My career journey started in the tech industry, where I worked as a Systems Engineer specializing in iOS application development at Infosys.
                In November 2023, I relocated to the UK to further my career and took on the role of a web developer and designer at DM Dzigns. I thrive in environments where continuous learning and professional growth are encouraged. I am committed to making a positive impact in every team and role I undertake.
